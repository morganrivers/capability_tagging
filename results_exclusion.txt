Overall: the model certainly doesn't understand exclusion in a general way :(


temperature 0.7

Success rate for possession: 21.99% (73 / 332)

things i'd expect it learns
that are interesting beyond grammar

characters help each other do things together

you can eat things like sandwiches

moms tell kids what to do

achieving something makes characters happy

possibly that you need to vary something that occurs once (we know for sure it doesn't know exclusion)

it does seem to understand ownership? 

the most impressive thing is that it really understands associations and categories pretty well.

maybe it knows that once a thing is drunk, its not around anymore

this is a really interesting case where knowing if you leave something, you can find it again. Or maybe its just an induction head leave -> find
(AFTER THE FACT: yeah, I'm pretty unconvinced this is anything other than [words] [words] example2 [words] [words] boosts example2)

and yet

this is just chance!

meaning that playing with something doesn't seem to increase the chances...

It really is not succeeding!

Really does not.

Let's try to mix up order and counts of things to see if that removes the signal

looks like it really does know what it means to positively add to the probability of an example, and reduce the probability based on the positive or negative affect. (AFTER THE FACT: NOPE. THIS IS A STATISTICAL ANOMALY! IT MOSTLY JUST PREDICTS EXAMPLE1)



this is also interesting, that using incorrect prompting formats (like using "favorite was a tomato" rather than "favorite was the tomato" can cause things to fail to work normally

(MODIFIED THIS ONE SLIGHTLY TO CORRECT EXAMPLE1EXAMPLE2 FLIP)
for possession, so this seems to indicate when something is found, it's understood as being had. And the fact that its found matters more.

for exclusion It seems the concept of losing things does not reduce the example1 prediction at all...

start_preference_balanced_count is the most striking. We see the only difference being the addition of ", but {pronoun} was getting tired of the {example1}" and this actually boosts example1!!

So what to do next: see if there are more common phrases that manage to dampen example1 even a little. If not, there's simply no inhibition between objects.

However, start_preference_reverse_order actually is quite interesting as it indicates that even though it's always example1 that is most recently seen, example2 is still boosted. The language model at least can boost. It may not be able to inhibit though...

so funny how much "iced" and "weighted" and "icky" seem to come up in this stuff... 

There's really no good evidence so far to indicate an understanding of "not" or negative.

 'start_exlu_using_a': '{irrelevant_content_1} {name} received two gifts: a '
                       '{first_example_shown} and a {second_example_shown}. '
                       '{irrelevant_content_2} {irrelevant_content_3} '
                       "{pronoun} didn't like a {example1} so {name}'s "
                       'favorite was a ',

why does this boost example1? because the language had a lot of things broken by the wired grammar ("a") and extra spaces, so it used the simple repeat heuristic. More complex heuristics are possible, but they need to look more like "the". 
So this means, I need to use really common words. Because really common words and contexts allow the model to exercise its more complex circuits.

once upon a time
girl named lily

very very common


"asked her what was wrong"


in general, lots of interaction between 2 characters going on
	do you want to play with my toys
	lets play hide and seek
lots of playing

lots of parks and dogs and being outside

lots of playing with toys with 2 characters

lots of dialog between mom and lily

things are often little


dialog seems to be about agreeing with parents, answering yes, or saying sorry for something or thank you

count: 8 | and said , `` do n't
count: 8 | said , `` yes , but


likely capability: understanding to hide is not to be seen. There but unseen. Being there doesn't require being seen.

another capability: commanded "don't" will imply the opposite. So when somebody says "don't worry", that will probably change the characters mind

usually it's don't [negative] -> positive, [negative] being worry, be scared, be sad, be shy

So a don't worry probably flips tone of story.

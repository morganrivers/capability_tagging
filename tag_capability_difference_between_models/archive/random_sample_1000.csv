"lily had a big cut on her knee. it hurt a lot and it was bleeding. she cried and ran to her mom. her mom hugged her and said, ""don't worry, lily. it will heal soon. i have a secret that can help.""

lily stopped crying and looked at her mom. ""what is the secret, mom?"" she asked.

her mom smiled and said, ""the secret is honey. honey is sweet and sticky and good for you. it can also heal your cut. it will make it stop hurting and bleeding and keep it clean.""

lily was curious and said, ""how can honey heal my cut, mom?""

her mom said, ""honey has something called magic in it. magic is a good thing that can do amazing things. magic can heal your cut by fighting the bad things that can make it worse. the bad things are called germs. germs are very small and you can't see them, but they can make you sick. honey has magic that can stop the germs and make your cut better.""

lily said, ""wow, mom. honey is amazing. can i try it?""

her mom said, ""of course, lily. but first, we have to wash your cut with water and soap. water and soap can also help heal your cut by washing away the dirt and the blood. dirt and blood can also have germs in them. washing your cut will make it ready for the honey.""

lily nodded and said, ""ok, mom. let's wash my cut.""

her mom took lily to the bathroom and washed her cut gently with water and soap. lily said, ""ouch, mom. it stings a little.""

her mom said, ""i know, lily. but it will only sting for a little while. it means that the water and soap are working. they are making your cut clean and safe. it will feel better soon.""

lily said, ""ok, mom. i trust you.""

her mom dried her cut with a soft towel and said, ""now, it's time for the honey. are you ready, lily?""

lily said, ""yes, mom. i'm ready.""

her mom took a jar of honey from the kitchen and a spoon. she scooped some honey with the spoon and said, ""now, lily, i'm going to put some honey on your cut. it might feel a little sticky and wet, but it will not hurt. it will feel sweet and warm and nice. it will make your cut heal faster and better. ok?""

lily said, ""ok, mom. i'm not scared.""

her mom put some honey on lily's cut and said, ""there, lily. how does it feel?""

lily said, ""it feels good, mom. it feels like a kiss from you. it doesn't hurt anymore. it feels like magic.""

her mom said, ""i'm glad, lily. you are very brave and smart. now, we have to cover your cut with a band-aid. a band-aid is a sticker that can protect your cut from the air and the dirt. it can also keep the honey in place. it can also have a picture on it that can make you happy. do you want a band-aid, lily?""

lily said, ""yes, mom. i want a band-aid. can i have one with a unicorn on it?""

her mom said, ""sure, lily. i have one right here. let me put it on your cut. there, lily. how do you like it?""

lily said, ""i love it, mom. it's beautiful. thank you, mom. you are the best.""

her mom said, ""you're welcome, lily. i love you, too. now, your cut will heal soon and you will be fine. but remember, lily, honey is a secret. you can't tell anyone about it. it's our special thing. ok?""

lily said, ""ok, mom. i won't tell anyone. honey is our secret. but can i ask you something, mom?""

her mom said, ""of course, lily. what do you want to ask me?""

lily said, ""mom, if honey can heal my cut, can it also heal other things? like a broken toy or a sad friend or a disgusting bug?""

her mom said, ""well, lily, honey can heal some things, but not everything. honey can heal things that are alive, like you and me and plants and animals. but honey can't heal things that are not alive, like toys and books and rocks. and honey can't heal things that are already dead, like bugs and leaves and flowers. and honey can't heal things that are in your heart, like feelings and dreams and wishes. those things need other things to heal, like glue"

mia had an idea. she whispered to tim: ""let's pray to god. maybe he can help us. maybe he can make the big boy go away or be nice to us.""

tim nodded. he liked mia's idea. he closed his eyes and folded his hands. he prayed to god in his heart. he said: ""dear god, please help us. we want to play on the swing. the big boy is mean and rude. he took our swing and hurt us. please make him go away or be nice to us. thank you, god. amen.""

mia did the same. she prayed to god in her heart. she said: ""dear god, please help us. we want to play on the swing. the big boy is mean and rude. he took our swing and hurt us. please make him go away or be nice to us. thank you, god. amen.""

they opened their eyes and looked at the swing. the big boy was still on it. he was still laughing and calling them names. he did not care about their prayers. he did not care about god.

tim and mia felt sad and hopeless. they did not understand why god did not help them. they did not understand why the big boy was so mean and rude. they did not understand why he was so ignorant and stupid. they wished they could have the swing back. they wished they could have fun again. they wished they could be happy again."

""okay,"" lily said, and nodded. ""but we can still be pirates, right?""

"ben and lily were best friends. they liked to play with marbles. they had many marbles of different colors and sizes. they always shared their marbles and played fair.

one day, they found a big, shiny marble in the park. it was the most beautiful marble they had ever seen. they both wanted it very much. they looked at each other and did not know what to do.

""let's part it,"" ben said. ""we can cut it in half and each have a piece.""

""no, let's not part it,"" lily said. ""it will break and lose its shine. let's take turns to play with it. you can have it today and i can have it tomorrow.""

ben thought for a moment. he really wanted the whole marble for himself. he had an idea. he said, ""okay, let's do that. but let's make a promise. we have to be honest and give it back when it is the other's turn. do you promise?""

lily nodded. she trusted ben. she said, ""i promise. do you promise?""

ben nodded. he lied. he said, ""i promise.""

they played with the marble for a while. then it was time to go home. ben put the marble in his pocket and said goodbye to lily. he did not give it back. he ran away.

lily was sad. she waited for ben the next day, but he did not come. she looked for him in the park, but he was not there. she asked his mom, but she said he was sick. she did not believe her. she knew ben had broken his promise. he had kept the marble for himself. he was not honest. he was not a good friend.

ben was happy. he had the marble for himself. he played with it in his room. he did not care about lily. he did not care about his promise. he was not honest. he was not a good friend.

but one day, something bad happened. ben was playing with the marble on his bed. he rolled it too hard and it fell off. it hit the floor and cracked. it lost its shine. it was broken. ben was shocked. he cried. he wished he had shared the marble with lily. he wished he had kept his promise. he wished he had been honest. he wished he had been a good friend.

the moral of the story is: be honest and share with your friends. if you are greedy and lie, you will lose what you have and what you love."

she decided to tell the truth. she went to her room and got the yarn. she brought it to her mom. she said she was sorry. she said she thought the yarn was hers. she said she wanted to make a blanket with it.

her mom hugged her. she said she was not angry. she said she was glad sara told the truth. she said the yarn was for sara's birthday. she said she wanted to make a sweater with it.

she asked sara if she wanted to help her. sara nodded. she said yes. she said she liked the yarn. she said she liked sweaters. she said she liked her mom.

they went to the couch and sat together. they took the yarn and the needles. they started to knit. they made a sweater with the yarn. it was very soft and shiny. it was pink and purple and blue. it was the most beautiful sweater ever.

sara was happy. she learned a lesson. she learned that sharing is better than hiding. she learned that telling the truth is better than lying. she learned that the yarn belonged to her and her mom. she learned that they belonged to each other."

her dad sighed and said, ""lily, we love you, but you have to be patient. we can't reply to you every time you ask something. sometimes, you have to find out things by yourself. or you can listen to a lecture. a lecture is when someone tells you a lot of things about something. like a teacher or a storyteller. do you want to listen to a lecture?""

lily thought for a moment. she liked to listen to stories. maybe a lecture was like a story. she nodded and said, ""yes, i want to listen to a lecture. who can give me a lecture?""

when dan went inside for dinner, he still had the candy. he asked his mom if he could eat it, and she said yes. little dan tasted the candy, and found it was very sweet, so he ate it all up.

they put the dinosaur in a big cage and loaded it on the truck. the dinosaur looked sad and scared. lily and ben hugged it and said goodbye. they told it they would miss it and that they hoped it would be happy.

the dinosaur nodded and made a soft sound. it remembered lily and ben and their toy dinosaurs. it was grateful and sad. it hoped it would see them again.

the truck drove away. lily and ben waved and cried. they went back to the house and looked at the book about dinosaurs. they learned more about the brontosaurus and other dinosaurs. they wondered if they would ever meet another dinosaur.

but then, lily saw a symbol that tom drew that she did not like. it was a square with a cross and a dot. she asked, ""what is this symbol, tom?"" tom said, ""this is a symbol for lily. you are a square because you are boring, a cross because you are mean, and a dot because you are small.""

lily felt hurt and angry. she said, ""that is not a nice symbol, tom. that is a mean symbol. you are not my friend."" she grabbed her papers and crayons and ran away. tom felt sorry and sad. he realized he had made a mistake.

"once upon a time there was a little girl named sunshine. she was a brave and adventurous three year old. one day, she decided to go on her own in the forest.

as she was walking along a path, she heard a crackling sound. looking up, she saw a broken shield in a nearby tree. she walked closer to take a better look. with a curious giggle, she reached out her hand to grab it.

suddenly, a voice rang out - ""you must never touch that shield."" sunshine jumped with surprise. she stepped back and looked around. but the forest was quiet. 

sunshine decided to listen to the mysterious voice. she repeated to herself, ""i will never touch the broken shield"". 

little did she know her words would be put to the test. a few days later sunshine returned to the same forest and found herself in an epic battle. when she felt she could take no more, she looked up to the tree and spotted the broken shield. taking her own advice, she reached out and grabbed the broken shield. it turned out to be the only weapon she had to protect herself and win the battle!

the moral of this story? listen to your instincts and repeat the wise words to yourself. you never know when they might come in handy."

""let's play on the hay!"" tim says.

""ok!"" jen says.

they climb up the hay and start to jump and roll. they laugh and have fun. but then, tim has an idea.

""let's make a fort with the hay!"" he says. ""we can use these sticks and these ropes to hold it together.""

jen looks at the sticks and the ropes. she does not like them. she thinks they are sharp and hard. she does not want to use them.

""no, let's not make a fort,"" she says. ""let's just jump and roll. the hay is soft and nice.""

""i want to make a fort!"" tim says.

""i don't want to make a fort!"" jen says.

"once upon a time there was a quiet sheep called daisy, who liked to wander about in the grassy fields by her farm house. one day, daisy boldly followed the sun as it started to set and she ended up at a tall, leather gate. 

the gate had an old, heavy padlock on it that daisy could not open. suddenly, she heard a friendly voice coming up from behind her, â€œwould you like me to show you what is behind this gate?â€

daisy was startled and turned around to see a white rabbit with long ears and a long, leather tail. daisy was happy to meet the rabbit, who introduced himself as mr. rabbit.

mr. rabbit explained, â€œif you follow me, i will lead you to a special place through the gate and you can discover what is around the bendâ€. 

daisy followed the rabbit beyond the leather gate, not knowing what was to come. the path was quiet as the two friends walked along, until they came upon a wondrous field. 

delighted, daisy shouted for joy, for she had discovered the most beautiful garden she had ever seen. daisy and mr. rabbit had plenty of fun exploring the garden together, until the sun set and it was time for daisy to go home. 

daisy thanked mr. rabbit for leading her to this special place and waved goodbye to him as she hopped away, content"
"once, there was a foolish sun who liked to shine all day long, even when the moon came out. one day, the moon was really mad. the moon shouted, ""enough! stop shining!"" the sun said, ""no, i won't stop. it is my job to shine all day long."" the moon said, ""if you don't stop, i will cover you up with a napkin."" the sun said, ""you can't catch me!"" and kept shining.

so, the moon grabbed a big napkin and covered the sun. the sun was so angry. he shouted, ""let me out!"" the moon said, ""no, you need to think before you shine too much."" the sun didn't understand and kept shouting. after a while, the moon said, ""okay, i will let you out if you promise to shine only when it is daytime."" the sun agreed and the moon took away the napkin.

the sun shone every day, but only when it was daytime. whenever the moon came out, the sun smiled and let the moon take over. the sun had learned his lesson and was no longer a foolish one."
